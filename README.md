# Polyglot packaging test

This is a demo repository showcasing how to make a small C++ package
with bindings in both R and Python. The key feature is that the code
can be directly installed from the github source in both R and Python.

## Python installation
`pip install "git+https://github.com/bnprks/polyglot-packaging-test#subdirectory=python"`

## R installation
`remotes::install_github("bnprks/BPCells/r")`
